Bulbasaur is a potent sweeper in the LC metagame, as Z-Celebrate allows it to clean mid- or late-game and sweep unprepared teams with ease. Additionally, its Z-Celebrate-boosted bulk and access to Sleep Powder allow it to take some hits from strong Pokemon or immobilize them after setting up, since its good defensive typing gives it some key resistances, such as Fighting, Fairy, and Water. Unfortunately, Bulbasaur is frail and weak without the Z-Celebrate boosts, and it lacks setup opportunities against most of the Pokemon in the metagame since it is weak to common types such as Psychic and Flying. Bulbasaur also has a bad movepool and has to rely on Hidden Power Fire to do significant damage to Steel- and Poison-types, even with a Z-Celebrate boost, which can only be obtained once. Bulbasaur is also outsped by common Choice Scarf users such as Doduo and Rufflet. Bulbasaur also faces competition with Pumpkaboo-S, as both can use Z-Moves to boost all of their stats, and Z-Trick-or-Treat is obviously more useful than Z-Celebrate.\\nCelebrate paired with Normalium Z gives Bulbasaur an invaluable boost in every stat, transforming it into a huge threat. Sludge Bomb is its main STAB move, OHKOing Doduo and 2HKOing Vullaby, metagame staples, after a boost. Giga Drain is also a powerful STAB move and gives Bulbasaur a reliable form of recovery against Water- and Ground-types, OHKOing offensive variants of Staryu and Mudbray after a boost. Hidden Power Fire gives Bulbasaur a method of 2HKOing Pawniard and Ferroseed, but Sleep Powder can be used instead, as it is useful against slower targets and gives Bulbasaur a way to set up reliably, but its low accuracy makes it a risky option. Synthesis can be used in the fourth slot as well, since it gives Bulbasaur longevity, but Giga Drain already provides recovery and Hidden Power Fire or Sleep Powder is usually better.\\nChlorophyll is the only available ability if Bulbasaur uses Celebrate, and Normalium Z is a must too. The Defense EVs on Bulbasaur allow it to take hits from strong physical attackers and be hard to revenge kill, as it survives one Ice Punch followed by a Mach Punch from Iron Fist Timburr after Stealth Rock damage. The rest of the EVs are invested in Special Attack and Speed, giving Bulbasaur more opportunities to sweep unprepared teams. Bulbasaur outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame after Z-Celebrate, but a Timid nature can be used instead of Modest to outspeed unboosted Nasty Plot Vullaby before using Z-Celebrate at the cost of making Bulbasaur much weaker; for example, a Modest nature ensures the 2HKO on Pumpkaboo-S after Stealth Rock.\\nBulbasaur is best used as a late-game sweeper or as a cleaner, so try to find setup opportunities against passive or slower Pokemon, such as Spritzee, Snubbull, and Timburr, by immobilizing them with Sleep Powder if Bulbasaur uses it on its set. Avoid setting up when your opponent has Pokemon that will eventually stop Bulbasaur, such as Steel-types and revenge killers. When playing against Pokemon that can check Bulbasaur effectively after a boost, use Sleep Powder to shut them down, but remember that Bulbasaur should stay healthy before it sets up. This includes avoiding status such as paralysis. Lastly, remove phazers such as Mareanie before setting up, as Bulbasaur is completely useless without the boosts provided by Z-Celebrate.\\nBulbasaur pairs well with answers to Flying-types such as Pawniard, Onix, and Kabuto, since most of the Flying-types carry Choice Scarf and, as a result, must be removed to ensure Bulbasaur's sweep. Chinchou in particular helps Bulbasaur against Flying-types, Magnemite, and Fire-types, especially Ponyta. Other Water-types, such as Staryu and Mareanie, can help Bulbasaur face the aforementioned Fire-types. Trappers are really appreciated teammates; Diglett traps the Steel-, Poison-, and Fire-types that might stop Bulbasaur's sweep, such as Magnemite and Ponyta, and Alolan Grimer traps Abra and Gastly, which revenge kill Bulbasaur easily. Steel-type checks such as Mienfoo, Timburr, Ponyta, and Diglett are indispensable teammates as well, since Bulbasaur can't hit them effectively even with a boosted Hidden Power Fire. Solid answers to Poison-types, including Groundium Z Diglett, Mudbray, and Abra, are pretty good teammates too. Fire-types such as Ponyta appreciate Bulbasaur's ability to take down Water- and Ground-types while they remove Steel-types and Foongus. Entry hazard setters such as Kabuto and Ferroseed can wear down Pokemon to ease Bulbasaur's sweep. Lastly, Bulbasaur strongly appreciates a slow VoltTurn from Pokemon such as Mienfoo or even Larvesta because it can switch-in safely and use Z-Celebrate against passive Pokemon.\\nDue to Bulbasaur's shallow movepool, Bulbasaur has very few other options to use effectively. Hidden Power Ground can be used instead of Hidden Power Fire to hit Poison-types harder while still hitting Pawniard, but some of the most important Poison-types such as Gastly and Foongus aren't significantly damaged by it, and it leaves Bulbasaur completely walled by Ferroseed. A defensive set with Eviolite may work, but it's outclassed by Foongus, which has a better movepool and Regenerator. A set with Choice Scarf can be used, but Bulbasaur is terribly weak without boosts and has very few coverage options.\\nFire-types: Fire-types such as Ponyta are huge threats to Bulbasaur, since they are faster than it without the Z-Celebrate boost and can boost their Speed via Flame Charge and Speed Boost, respectively. However, Bulbasaur hits these Fire-types hard enough with Sludge Bomb to 2HKO, and it can put them to sleep with Sleep Powder.\\nFlying-types: Common Flying-types such as Vullaby and Doduo can threaten Bulbasaur with their strong STAB attacks, and they can use Choice Scarf to revenge kill Bulbasaur without forcing some Pokemon to be sacrificed to defeat it.\\nBulky Steel-types: Ferroseed, Pawniard, and Magnemite can threaten Bulbasaur if it's not running Fire-type coverage, and some of them can take one hit or two from it, even if it's running Hidden Power Fire or Hidden Power Ground.\\nRevenge Killers: Revenge killers such as Focus Sash Abra, Choice Scarf Amaura, and Choice Scarf Doduo can force Bulbasaur out if they don't just OHKO it.\\nPoison-types: Poison-types such as Mareanie and Foongus can easily take any hit from Bulbasaur and remove its Z-Celebrate boosts by using Haze or Clear Smog.\\n.\n",
